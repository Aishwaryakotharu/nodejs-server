### Tech

In my current project a number of open source projects have been used:

* [Visual studion code] - awesome web-based text editor
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Git] -  the streaming build system
* [Breakdance](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - HTML to Markdown 

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```
$ git init
